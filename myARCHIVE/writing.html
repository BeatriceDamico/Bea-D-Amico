				<div class="story1">  <p> Socks, 2011 <br> <br>

					The pungent smell made him wrinkle his nose. It was diffusing across the room making everyone want to plug their noses. What is that smell? He looks around but loses interest of the curiosity in the room. He pokes his head out the window of the building and sees a man looking in the trash out in the pouring rain. The man finds a pair of socks from the trashcan and places an enormous smile on his face. The boy in the room looks around at all the privileged noses complaining for good problems to have with easy solutions while there is someone outside looking through something much smellier with nothing but hope to find good perfume. I am so lucky, the boy thought to himself. Suddenly he bends down to take off his shoes and removes his new socks and opens the window still seeing the man smiling with his treasures. He throws the pair of socks down below to the man quickly hiding himself behind the window to not be seen. A brand new pair of socks land right next to the trash can, soaking up all the water from the rain above. The man with double the treasure looks up into the sky, and thanks God for hearing his prayers. </p>
