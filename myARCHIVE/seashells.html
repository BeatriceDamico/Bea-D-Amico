	<div class="story2"> <p> Seashells, Jan. 6, 2017 <br> <br>



I have many wonders about life underwater. I feel like one pea-sized sea shell in the infinite salty waters of the sea. My dirty-white shell is covered with light beige specks, almost like freckles. I seem to be beautiful on the outside. That is because so many hands pick me up from the sand and pull me out of the salty water, where I am exposed to the wind drying the water speckles off my shell. And I am observed. I am turned around a lot and every once in awhile I hear, “wow, look at this one.” Then I am eventually dropped at a quick speed, which instantly slows down as soon as I hit the surface of the salty water. I slowly fall down back down to the sand, always at a different spot then the last one. Home. The salty water is my home. I taste the saltiness of the water that burns my taste buds in my mouth and lips, which keep me from smiling. It keeps me from happiness. It’s so salty it blinds my eyes from seeing the free-moving fish swimming around me and above me. So I keep my eyes shut, and I just listen. I sit, I listen and I wait patiently for the next hand to pick me up. 
My shell is completely empty in the inside. It is so empty that only my heartbeat echoes against the walls of my shell. I scream and I scream for someone to hear me, to help me, to free me from this empty shell, this salty water, this hell I call home. 
Echo. Nothing.
There’s silence in the water around me. My screaming remains silent. The only sound I hear is the slimy skin of the little yet enormous fish above me, swarming against the current’s waters, free. But I see nothing because opening my eyes stings my vision of my salted reality. 
He looked me dead in the eye to remind me who's the boss around this place. My eyes burned of my salty tears falling down my face. I didn’t mind crying anymore. Crying only blurred my sight of him. I hate him. I hate sharks. He let the hands pick me up when they’re hungry, as I lay there in bed, useless. Most days over 100 kinds of hands grab me, hungry. Sometimes I just want to scream, “you’re eating bad food, you’re bad. I’m just a seashell!” But I don’t, because what does that change? It’s just another crack to my shell or maybe even just a scar to my “freckles” if I’m lucky. The seashells around me have it the same. 
I forgot about my life outside the shore. When I was beautiful inside and out. But I try not to think about it because I’ll only suffer for dreaming of the things I don’t have anymore. Freedom. A hand grabs my shell again, looks at my beautiful speckles, then drops me back into the salty water’s current, which takes me at the bottom of the sea floor where the rough, dark brown sand lies. I sit, and I wait.
 I hear a door open as I lay on the rough, dark brown floor next to the bed, where I was placed by the man. The shark. I wipe my salty tears off my cheek and quickly rush to the bed, quietly. A smaller shark appears by the door, approaching me slowly. I open my legs to not get bit if i do not behave. The man gets on the bed and takes off his belt, then unzips his pants. He grabs me to turn me around and says, “Wow, look at this one.” I hear my heartbeat echo in my body, and I scream silently. Nothing. Salty tears run down my cheeks and my vision starts to blur my reality. I close my eyes, and listen, waiting to be dropped again anywhere into the salty seawater where I belong. After all I am just a seashell.
