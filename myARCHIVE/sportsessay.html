	<div class="story2"> Running (and trying to get into Parsons) <br> 2016 <br> <br> 
	One year, 6 months, and 11 days ago, was the day my life changed from a girl who tried her best to excel in everything, to something else. Useless. I was going up to hit a Volleyball, a ball I was used to seeing everyday for almost five years, until the ball flyed past me and became a figure of my illusion in space. A pop in my left knee triggered my mind to see that everything was over. I lost the thought of getting the ball, I lost the thought of my teammates depending on me to score, and I lost the thought of how, a second prior, I was strong and healthy. I forced myself to tune out the people yelling in my ears, which gratefully still seemed to be working. I shut my eyes to squeeze the tears out of my eyes, and to focus on the dark that blinded me rather then that light hurt me.

	<br>

           After three MRI scans, and several x-ray tests, the doctors finally told me I tore my acl on my left knee. I didn't cry because of the feeling that I just got hit by a truck, I cried because my volleyball career felt like it came to an end too soon. I later find out that what really ended, was my confidence. The new me, the "useless" version, the side I never thought I could be capable of reaching, dominated my mind in thinking I wouldn't excel anymore at anything. The first couple months of recovering from surgery, I worked hard to keep in shape, meaning I did as much as I could do with two arms and one leg. When I started to play Volleyball again after nine months, I had no patience in myself because I wanted and expected to become a good player right away. I became insecure in my capabilities and I lost trust in my body. I decided to start fresh. I wanted a clean slate, where I could comfortably build my confidence again. I gave up on Volleyball, which is the first time I have given up on anything in my life, and decided I wanted to start to run Track.  At first I saw this sport as a waste of time, because you can run any time on your own. But as I attended a couple practices, I experienced its attraction. It was a sport where you challenge yourself, and the person next to you doesn't matter because they're running on their own clock. Their own time. My track coach saw potential in my speed and decided to put me in the 100 meter dash where you sprint until the finish line. I felt less scared because in my case, Track was about running straight, where I didn't have to focus on any turns, just on the line I was determined to cross. When it came to my first Track race, I was assigned to run the 400 meter sprint, which wasn't what I was used to running. But as I walked on the field, I remember thinking that that was my time, my time to prove to myself that my old-self, was still part of me, and I wouldn't give up to finish that race. I took my stance to wait for the go, the silence gave me a second to realize my new environment. I had to do it, I had to finish. The gun fired, and I sprinted. I fell in love with the adrenaline rushing though my body because that was the first moment in months where I didn't feel useless. I wasn't running for my coach, or for my parents, I was running for me, for I was running on my own clock. I was approaching the finish line; my eyes felt watery, and my mouth dry like the desert. I would get closer but see my confidence run farther. It ran so fast, that it pushed me down to the ground to run the opposite direction. A foot away from finishing, from finally accomplishing and overcoming all my fears, I fainted.

           <br>

              The story repeats, only for a shorter amount of time. I lost my confidence, again, and I felt like the biggest failure. I kept training, because I didn't want to give up on one more thing, and that would mean giving up on myself. My next race terrified me because I was scared to fall a third time. All I kept repeating in my mind was, "what did I do to deserve so much failure?" Karma may have torn my acl for my over-confident behavior, but fainting before the finish line only deserved a second chance.
<br>
        What happened in my second Track race? I would say, it doesn't matter. Because every race after the first, I exceled. My confidence didn't run faster then me, it ran with me. I ran so fast, that I left all the insecurites, complaints,  and scarring memories behind. By the end of the season I helped brake the school record with my relay team, I got second best time in my school's history, and I made it to the Northern California Championships after winning League Champion. I underestimated myself too much and the feeling of earning my strong mentality back was the best moment I had lived. Tearing my acl changed my life for the better, because if I hadn't torn it, I wouldn't see what it was like to work that hard for something. I see myself as a treasure chest, where I may have been special once, but it took me a long time stuck under the dark ocean, only to get found again with more value. Joining Track taught me that running it isn't about winning, it's more about the feeling you get when you cross the finish line. The adrenaline is worth feeling even if you end with a loss. And what I learned from fainting that I wish I had learned sooner from injuring myself, is that the real champion is the person that gets back up and crosses the finish line.
<br>

          I laid on the couch in the living room, keeping up with Walter White's attempts to kill Gus, in Breaking Bad. I was immobile, I was useless. I tore my acl, so I couldn't do much but change shows on netflix. Breaking Bad  finished quickly, so I moved on to watching all the episodes of America's Next Top Model.  I did absolutely nothing for nine months except study, so I could feel that I didn't disappear entirely. You know the story. I lost all my confidence but by the end of my Junior year in high school I gained my old self back with the help of Track. Being insecure also affected my outside life, which makes up more of my time rather than sports. I am very passionate for fashion photography and my dream is to be part of the fashion industry. During my recovery, since I was mentally unstable, I thought to myself that I wasn't even capable of working on my portfolio anymore. But regaining my stability, it got me back on the right path to working with what I love most. I came up with the idea to make up a mock-up magazine where I created my own styled-magazine with my own work and brand names. I fell in even more love with sketching an idea for an image, directing my models, and seeing the results through Photoshop and Lightroom. I started studying again, not school studies, but fashion studies, where I read my photography books and looked over all of Vogues, Harpar's Bazaar and Elle's magazine published since 2013. I would say true success is happiness, and with my new mentality, I have the confidence to excel at Parsons, and I hope that this is the school that helps me cross the finish line.
