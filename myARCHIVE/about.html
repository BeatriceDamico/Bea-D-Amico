<p>
I started my life pursuing my career as a professional photographer then was introduced to a design program which flipped my life upside down. I mastered the camera (including video) and all Adobe programs including Illustrator and InDesign. I discovered at a young age the power of questioning WHY. When designing I ask myself two questions: Why did I, or the designer, create this in the form that I/they did? And what can I do to make this better? For example, why did I choose to make the font for "Coffee" yellow and not blue?  What other fonts can be more aesthetically pleasing for “Coffee” then it is now? Asking "why" allows me to expand my own perspective, and most importantly understand the perspective of my clients. I am fast paced, and clever at understanding what my clients need from me as a designer. I make sure my clients are satisfied with their final product. I am here to understand what you need as a final objective, and what you want as a final design product. I design logos, flyers, brochures, posters, book/album covers, business cards and all other advertising elements in digital and print.
