	<div class="story1">  <p> Snickers <br> 2016 <br> <br> Ads. Ads. Ads. They surround our walks to the corner store and our drive through the highway. They dominate our computer screens and interrupt our movies and TV shows. They cover kid’s cereal boxes, and the surface of subways, buses and taxis. Ads are the most powerful way to reach a person’s desire.

	<br>
	
The most successful messages are the ones people can relate to in their lives. My favorite commercial that speaks true to that statement are the Snickers Bars commercials. Snickers starts their slogan with, “Packed with peanuts, Snickers really satisfies” which emphasizes a Snickers Bar’s replacement to a full meal, convincing the audience that you can be “satisfied” with just one bar. Years ago, Snickers mainly focused on the life of athletes, such as football players that would and end their game starving, needed a Snickers to “satisfy” their hunger. Who can’t relate to hunger after playing sports? Already made clear that Snickers is packed with peanuts, their slogan changes to “Snickers really satisfies,” which according to Robert Klara in Ad week, he states that, “-the bar’s stomach-filling properties made it a runaway hit after Ted Bates Worldwide coined the “‘Snickers really satisfies’” tag in 1979.”

<br>

As the repetitive, yet powerful word “satisfies” became clear to the viewers of these ads, Snickers recently began to speak directly to individuals with the slogan they have now, “You’re not you when you’re hungry.” This doesn’t just speak to athletes, it speaks to Americans who could feel hungry about three times a day. In E.J Schultz article in Ad Age, he states that Snickers is the “new candy kingpin,” where according to Euromonitor projections, “Snickers is expected to surge from $3.29 billion in global sales last year to $3.57 billion for 2012, capturing a 1.8% share.” With their new slogan, Snickers surpassed M&Ms financially, being the number one candy bar in the world. The ads now focus on your average American “joe” who is angry or just having a bad day, and after one bite, all of a sudden “joe” transforms to the person he really looks like. Snickers successfully implies that one bar, even better, one bite, can bring you back to the real you. Not only does Snicker’s “satisfy,” but it now brings a sense of identity. 
Snickers effectively adds humor to their commercials, such as the “grandmother” Betty White, running in a football field, which happens to be a player who doesn’t feel he is “himself.” A humorous ad sticks in a person’s mind, especially kids, who are many companies’ main targets. When kids see a Snickers bar they could immediately think of “hungry Betty White” playing football or even better, another Snicker’s commercial where a zebra chases a lion, when in reality it should be the other way around. 
Snickers commercials are great examples of connecting with a person’s basic feeling of hunger. It is human to feel hungry, so they make their ads imply that you not only want a Snickers bar, but you need one. Klara also states in Adweek that “Snickers has retained all the brand familiarity it won with years of the old slogan by retaining its most powerful word: satisfies.” Its meaning not only sells the product by implying that one bar replaces a meal, but its a catchy phrase. “Snickers Satisfies” is an alliteration of the letter s which is effective because it is easy to say and remember. Snickers relates to every individual by showing how people don’t act like themselves when they are hungry. So remember when you’re having a bad day to eat a Snickers bar because “you’re not you when you’re hungry.”
