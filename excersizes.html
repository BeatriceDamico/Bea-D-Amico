App- notes

<br>
<br>


Objectives: a virtual notebook that fits in your pocket and allows users to jot down thoughts, memories, personal objectives, and all other info one would write in a notebook. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

Audience: mostly all ages
<br>

10-25: mostly students and teens who jot down notes for school, or personal thoughts for themselves
<br>

25-on: workers, and all other humans who feel forgetful and need to write something down. etc
<br>
<br>

-People who don’t want to waste paper use notes.
-People who don’t have space in their bag for a notebook/find notebooks pointless with technology.
-People who like the idea of keeping notes in their pocket (technically it is pocket size)

<br>
<br>


Needs: a place that the user can depend on to go back to their past writing and recall all the thoughts and plans/ideas/etc that the user wrote. 

<br>
<br>
<br>




Scope of Notes

Can save to the icloud
-user can keep it forever in the cloud if it is very important
Can create a new note rather than have one page
User can have multiple notes like an actual notebook experience
Can edit
Users can go back and “erase” past writing or write new notes
Everytime you write on a note whether it is new or old, it goes back to the top
User is reminded of most recents notes just in case they need to write in it again.


As a writer
 I want to write my thoughts
So i can remember them in the future.






SCOPE

feasibility - how possible it is

what are the most important requirements this project will fail without?
